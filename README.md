🤖RULE-BASED PYTHON CHATBOT
A simple and user-friendly rule-based chatbot built using Python.
The chatbot responds to user inputs using predefined rules and also greets the user based on the current time of day

🚀 Features
Time-based greetings such as Good Morning, Good Afternoon, Good Evening, and Good Night.
Keyword-based response system using a memory dictionary.
Friendly interactions including jokes, facts, and general responses.
Continuous chat loop that runs until the user types “exit”.
Beginner-friendly structure, ideal for students and academic mini-projects.

🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.x
Basic knowledge of input/output
datetime module (comes built-in)

🧠 How It Works
The user enters their name.
The chatbot greets them based on the current system time.
The user types any message/question.
The chatbot scans for keywords in the user’s message.
If a matching keyword exists, it returns the corresponding predefined response.
If no keyword matches, it shows a default “I don’t understand” message.
The conversation continues until the user types “exit”.

💬 Example Chat Flow
User enters name.
Chatbot greets based on time.
User asks: “hi” → Chatbot replies: “Hi there!”
User asks for a joke → Chatbot sends a joke.
User types “exit” → Chatbot ends the session politely.

🎯 Possible Enhancements (Future Work)
Add voice recognition or speech output.
Create a GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt.
Add machine learning/NLP features for smarter responses.
Store chat history in a file.
Add more categories of responses.
